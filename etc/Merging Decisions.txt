Meging Decisions:

We took Efraim's Project and continued it. (and added a few nice things Avi had made manually).

The idea of the merging was taking Efraim's nice division of the project of Efi, and it's nice
suitability for incoming new request, and the simple solution of the game rules Avi made.
